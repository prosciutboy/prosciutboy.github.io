title: Jekyll and Poole to blog on Github
---

I am wondering how come you arrived here and I will probably never know it because I haven't activated any javascript that would tell me more on this. Anyway you are welcome to read and stay here as long as you don't get bored.

I will post on this blog some of my tech notes and scripts, this may be useful for me in the future and for you even right now.

Note that this blog is generated using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. From [the project's readme](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown):

  > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

Find out more by [visiting the project on GitHub](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

I use Jekyll with [Poole configured with the Hyde layout](hyde.getpoole.comhyde.getpoole.com). Give it a try !
